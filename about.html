  <p>Dance is a practice where students are taught a broad understanding of dance as an art form or trained
    professionally in specific dance .<br>
    Dance education also encompasses a research area in which scholars conduct original research on ways of teaching
    and learning dance. <br>
    Currently, dance itself is considered an allied form of art and music, thus dance in formal education is closely
    knit with these disciplines. </p>
