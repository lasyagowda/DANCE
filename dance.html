          <h2>Bharthanatyam</h2>
          <p>Bharatanatyam is a dance of Tamil Nadu in southern India. It traces its origins back to the Natyashastra,
            an ancient treatise on theatre written by the mythic priest Bharata. Originally a temple dance for women,
            bharatanatyam often is used to express Hindu religious stories and devotions.</p>

            <p>Kathak is characterized by intricate footwork and precise rhythmic patterns that the dancer articulates
              by controlling about 100 ankle bells.
              It takes its movements from life, stylizes them, and adds the complex rhythmic patterns.
              Kathak is danced by both males and females; many of the dances convey moods of love.</p>

              Tap dancing can also be done using an a cappella method,
              in which no musical accompaniment is provided, and dancers create their own "music" through the sounds of
              their taps.</p>

            <p>Free dance is a 20th-century dance form that preceded modern dance. Rebelling against the rigid
              constraints of classical ballet, Loie Fuller,
              Isadora Duncan and Ruth St. Denis (with her work in theater) developed their own styles of free dance and
              laid the foundations of American modern dance with their choreography and teaching.
