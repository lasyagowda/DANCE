  <p>Dance is a practice where students are taught a broad understanding of dance as an art form or trained
    professionally in specific dance .<br>
    Dance education also encompasses a research area in which scholars conduct original research on ways of teaching
    and learning dance. <br>
    Currently, dance itself is considered an allied form of art and music, thus dance in formal education is closely
    knit with these disciplines. </p>

          <h2>Bharthanatyam</h2>

            an ancient treatise on theatre written by the mythic priest Bharata. Originally a temple dance for women,
           bharatanatyam often is used to express Hindu religious stories and devotions.</p>

          <h2>Kathak</h2> 
          <p>Kathak is characterized by intricate footwork and precise rhythmic patterns that the dancer articulates by controlling about 100 ankle bells.
             It takes its movements from life, stylizes them, and adds the complex rhythmic patterns. 
            Kathak is danced by both males and females; many of the dances convey moods of love.</p>

      <h2>Free-Style</h2> 
      <p>Free dance is a 20th-century dance form that preceded modern dance. Rebelling against the rigid constraints of classical ballet, Loie Fuller, 
        Isadora Duncan and Ruth St. Denis (with her work in theater) developed their own styles of free dance and laid the foundations of American modern dance with their choreography and teaching.
